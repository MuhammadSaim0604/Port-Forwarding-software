I give a prompt to the ai agent here is my prompt: 
[
Generate a python based software which have a web Dashboard of Management in this dashboard we can manage our tunnels we can download option for .bat file for windows. We can create or manage tunnels.

Basically this software is mainly use for port forwarding means when we create a tunnel in dashboard and run .bat file in the windows then it tries to connect to our this software when it successfully connects it it gives us a url for verification when we go to this URL in the browser then our software will connect to the our Windows and then our software will give us a public IP and Port so we can use this public IP and Port any type of traffic on this IP and Port will redirect to our Windows machine through the tunnel created between our software and window.

the ai agent worked and replied me after doing coding:

The user wants a Python-based web dashboard for managing tunnels that enable port forwarding. Let me break down the requirements:

Web Dashboard for tunnel management
Can create and manage tunnels
Can download .bat files for Windows clients
When a .bat file is run on Windows:
It connects to the software
Shows a URL for verification
Once verified, creates a tunnel
Provides a public IP and port
Traffic to that public IP/port gets forwarded to the Windows machine
This is essentially a self-hosted tunnel/ngrok-like service. The architecture would be:

Web dashboard (Python/Flask or similar)
Tunnel server that accepts connections from clients
Client .bat files that establish the tunnel
Database to manage tunnel configurations
Let me start by exploring the codebase to see what exists, then create a comprehensive plan.

I'll help you build a Python-based tunnel management system with a web dashboard. This will allow you to create tunnels, generate .bat files for Windows clients, and forward traffic through those tunnels.

Let me first explore the current project structure and then create a comprehensive implementation plan.

Opened home directory

Searched for "existing Python files or web frameworks"

Planned tunnel management system architecture (4 seconds)
The directory is empty, so I'm starting from scratch. I need to build a complete tunnel management system. Let me plan out the architecture:

Web Dashboard - Flask-based web interface
Tunnel Server - Socket server that accepts connections from Windows clients
Database - SQLite for managing tunnels and their state
Client Generator - Generate .bat files for Windows
Proxy Server - Handle incoming traffic and forward to the tunnel
Key components:

Flask web app for the dashboard
WebSocket or TCP server for tunnel connections
Verification system (URL-based verification)
Public port allocation and traffic forwarding
.bat file generation
This is a complex multi-step task, so I should use a task list.

after this response it created lot of system coding but I again give a new prompt to the ai agent:
[
make sure do not give url everytime for verification we need only one time verification and also solve this tunnel issue
]

and its repsonse:

[Perfect! I've fixed both issues:

✅ Fixes Applied:
1. Fixed WebSocket Connection Error
Added websocket-client package to the installation command
The .bat file now installs: python-socketio, requests, and websocket-client
2. True One-Time Verification
Now the .bat file works smartly:

First Run (Not Verified):

Shows verification URL
Prompts you to verify in browser
Exits and asks you to run again after verification
Second Run (Already Verified):

Skips verification message completely
Goes straight to installing packages and connecting
No more repeated verification URLs!
📋 How to Use (Updated):
Download the .bat file from the dashboard
First time:
Run the .bat file
It will show the verification URL
Open that URL in your browser to verify
Run the .bat file again
Every time after:
Just run the .bat file
It connects automatically (no verification needed!)
The tunnel stays verified permanently in the database, so you only need to verify once per tunnel, ever.

Try downloading a fresh .bat file now - after you verify the tunnel once, you'll never see that verification message again! 🎉]



I again give another prompt to the ai agent:
[
also make sure if our local machine tries to send any thing then this tunnel and software also forwards the response correctly means request and response both

And also solve this tunnel this issue see the console logs and also these cmd side logs

after solving these make sure to show public ip also in the dashboard with every tunnel near public port

it did some work and fixed.

i again give another prompt:

Fix this Python-based tunnel management system to properly forward ALL types of traffic (TCP, UDP, TCP+UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, raw sockets) from public ports to local ports through WebSocket connections.

CURRENT ISSUES:
1. Traffic forwarding fails - client doesn't receive traffic_data events
2. Only handles HTTP traffic, needs to handle raw TCP/UDP
3. SocketIO emit errors with threading mode
4. Proxy server needs to handle binary data correctly
5. Client-server communication is unstable

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Server (app.py + proxy_server.py):
   - Use Flask-SocketIO with threading mode (NOT eventlet - Python 3.12 incompatible)
   - Proxy server must accept ANY TCP/UDP traffic on public ports (10000-60000 range)
   - Forward raw binary data (not just HTTP) through WebSocket to connected clients
   - Handle multiple simultaneous connections per tunnel
   - Proper timeout handling (60s) and error responses
   - Fix socketio.emit() to work with threading mode (remove broadcast parameter)

2. Client (simple_client.py):
   - Receive traffic_data events reliably via WebSocket
   - Forward raw binary data to localhost:<local_port> via TCP socket
   - Send responses back through WebSocket
   - Handle TCP and UDP protocols
   - Maintain persistent connection with heartbeat
   - Proper error handling and reconnection logic

3. Protocol Support:
   - TCP (any protocol: HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, custom)
   - UDP (game servers, VoIP, DNS)
   - Mixed TCP+UDP on same tunnel
   - Binary data handling without corruption
   - Large payload support (>10MB)

4. Windows Compatibility:
   - Works on Python 3.11-3.12
   - No eventlet dependency
   - Use threading async mode
   - Generate .bat files for easy Windows client deployment

Make all necessary changes to app.py, proxy_server.py, simple_client.py, and requirements.txt to create a production-ready tunnel system that works reliably on Windows.
